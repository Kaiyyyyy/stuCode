This is the most basic sample web application for Spring Security.

If you have gradle installed, you can run the application directly from the checked out source tree, using the command

gradle jettyRun

This will start jetty on port 8080, with SSL support on port 8443.

The 'scripts' directory contains simple Unix command-line scripts for exercising the application and displaying the results.
