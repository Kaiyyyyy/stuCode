[[authentication]]
= Authentication

Spring Security provides comprehensive support for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication[authentication].
Authentication is how we verify the identity of who is trying to access a particular resource.
A common way to authenticate users is by requiring the user to enter a username and password.
Once authentication is performed we know the identity and can perform authorization.
