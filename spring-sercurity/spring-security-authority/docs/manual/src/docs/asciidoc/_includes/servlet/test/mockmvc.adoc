== Spring MVC Test Integration

Spring Security provides comprehensive integration with https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/testing.html#spring-mvc-test-framework[Spring MVC Test]

[[test-mockmvc-setup]]
=== Setting Up MockMvc and Spring Security

In order to use Spring Security with Spring MVC Test it is necessary to add the Spring Security `FilterChainProxy` as a `Filter`.
It is also necessary to add Spring Security's `TestSecurityContextHolderPostProcessor` to support <<Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations>>.
This can be done using Spring Security's `SecurityMockMvcConfigurers.springSecurity()`.
For example:

NOTE: Spring Security's testing support requires spring-test-4.1.3.RELEASE or greater.

[source,java]
----

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.setup.SecurityMockMvcConfigurers.*;

@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = SecurityConfig.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
public class CsrfShowcaseTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebApplicationContext context;

	private MockMvc mvc;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		mvc = MockMvcBuilders
				.webAppContextSetup(context)
				.apply(springSecurity()) // <1>
				.build();
	}

...
----

<1> `SecurityMockMvcConfigurers.springSecurity()` will perform all of the initial setup we need to integrate Spring Security with Spring MVC Test

[[test-mockmvc-smmrpp]]
=== SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors

Spring MVC Test provides a convenient interface called a `RequestPostProcessor` that can be used to modify a request.
Spring Security provides a number of `RequestPostProcessor` implementations that make testing easier.
In order to use Spring Security's `RequestPostProcessor` implementations ensure the following static import is used:

[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.request.SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*;
----

[[test-mockmvc-csrf]]
==== Testing with CSRF Protection

When testing any non-safe HTTP methods and using Spring Security's CSRF protection, you must be sure to include a valid CSRF Token in the request.
To specify a valid CSRF token as a request parameter using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(post("/").with(csrf()))
----

If you like you can include CSRF token in the header instead:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(post("/").with(csrf().asHeader()))
----

You can also test providing an invalid CSRF token using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(post("/").with(csrf().useInvalidToken()))
----

[[test-mockmvc-securitycontextholder]]
==== Running a Test as a User in Spring MVC Test

It is often desirable to run tests as a specific user.
There are two simple ways of populating the user:

* <<Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor>>
* <<Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations>>

[[test-mockmvc-securitycontextholder-rpp]]
==== Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor

There are a number of options available to associate a user to the current `HttpServletRequest`.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "user", the password "password", and the role "ROLE_USER":

[NOTE]
====
The support works by associating the user to the `HttpServletRequest`.
To associate the request to the `SecurityContextHolder` you need to ensure that the `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` is associated with the `MockMvc` instance.
A few ways to do this are:

* Invoking <<test-mockmvc-setup,apply(springSecurity())>>
* Adding Spring Security's `FilterChainProxy` to `MockMvc`
* Manually adding `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` to the `MockMvc` instance may make sense when using `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup`
====

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user("user")))
----

You can easily make customizations.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "pass", and the roles "ROLE_USER" and "ROLE_ADMIN".

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/admin").with(user("admin").password("pass").roles("USER","ADMIN")))
----

If you have a custom `UserDetails` that you would like to use, you can easily specify that as well.
For example, the following will use the specified `UserDetails` (which does not need to exist) to run with a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` that has a principal of the specified `UserDetails`:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user(userDetails)))
----

You can run as anonymous user using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(anonymous()))
----

This is especially useful if you are running with a default user and wish to process a few requests as an anonymous user.

If you want a custom `Authentication` (which does not need to exist) you can do so using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(authentication(authentication)))
----

You can even customize the `SecurityContext` using the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(securityContext(securityContext)))
----

We can also ensure to run as a specific user for every request by using ``MockMvcBuilders``'s default request.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "password", and the role "ROLE_ADMIN":

[source,java]
----
mvc = MockMvcBuilders
		.webAppContextSetup(context)
		.defaultRequest(get("/").with(user("user").roles("ADMIN")))
		.apply(springSecurity())
		.build();
----

If you find you are using the same user in many of your tests, it is recommended to move the user to a method.
For example, you can specify the following in your own class named `CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors`:

[source,java]
----
public static RequestPostProcessor rob() {
	return user("rob").roles("ADMIN");
}
----

Now you can perform a static import on `SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors` and use that within your tests:

[source,java]
----
import static sample.CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*;

...

mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(rob()))
----

===== Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations

As an alternative to using a `RequestPostProcessor` to create your user, you can use annotations described in <<Testing Method Security>>.
For example, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE_USER":

[source,java]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
----

Alternatively, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE_ADMIN":

[source,java]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles="ADMIN")
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
----

==== Testing HTTP Basic Authentication

While it has always been possible to authenticate with HTTP Basic, it was a bit tedious to remember the header name, format, and encode the values.
Now this can be done using Spring Security's `httpBasic` `RequestPostProcessor`.
For example, the snippet below:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(httpBasic("user","password")))
----

will attempt to use HTTP Basic to authenticate a user with the username "user" and the password "password" by ensuring the following header is populated on the HTTP Request:

[source,text]
----
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
----

[[testing-oauth2]]
==== Testing OAuth 2.0

When it comes to OAuth 2.0, the same principles covered earlier still apply: Ultimately, it depends on what your method under test is expecting to be in the `SecurityContextHolder`.

For example, for a controller that looks like this:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(Principal user) {
    return user.getName();
}
----

There's nothing OAuth2-specific about it, so you will likely be able to simply <<test-method-withmockuser,use `@WithMockUser`>> and be fine.

But, in cases where your controllers are bound to some aspect of Spring Security's OAuth 2.0 support, like the following:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user) {
    return user.getIdToken().getSubject();
}
----

then Spring Security's test support can come in handy.

[[testing-oidc-login]]
==== Testing OIDC Login

Testing the method above with Spring MVC Test would require simulating some kind of grant flow with an authorization server.
Certainly this would be a daunting task, which is why Spring Security ships with support for removing this boilerplate.

For example, we can tell Spring Security to include a default `OidcUser` using the `SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors#oidcLogin` method, like so:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint").with(oidcLogin()));
----

What this will do is configure the associated `MockHttpServletRequest` with an `OidcUser` that includes a simple `OidcIdToken`, `OidcUserInfo`, and `Collection` of granted authorities.

Specifically, it will include an `OidcIdToken` with a `sub` claim set to `user`:

[source,json]
----
assertThat(user.getIdToken().getClaim("sub")).isEqualTo("user");
----

an `OidcUserInfo` with no claims set:

[source,json]
----
assertThat(user.getUserInfo().getClaims()).isEmpty();
----

and a `Collection` of authorities with just one authority, `SCOPE_read`:

[source,json]
----
assertThat(user.getAuthorities()).hasSize(1);
assertThat(user.getAuthorities()).containsExactly(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_read"));
----

Spring Security does the necessary work to make sure that the `OidcUser` instance is available for <<mvc-authentication-principal,the `@AuthenticationPrincipal` annotation>>.

Further, it also links that `OidcUser` to a simple instance of `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` that it deposits into an mock `OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`.
This can be handy if your tests <<testing-oauth2-client,use the `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` annotation>>..

[[testing-oidc-login-authorities]]
===== Configuring Authorities

In many circumstances, your method is protected by filter or method security and needs your `Authentication` to have certain granted authorities to allow the request.

In this case, you can supply what granted authorities you need using the `authorities()` method:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oidcLogin()
            .authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_message:read"))
        )
    );
----

[[testing-oidc-login-claims]]
===== Configuring Claims

And while granted authorities are quite common across all of Spring Security, we also have claims in the case of OAuth 2.0.

Let's say, for example, that you've got a `user_id` claim that indicates the user's id in your system.
You might access it like so in a controller:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser) {
    String userId = oidcUser.getIdToken().getClaim("user_id");
    // ...
}
----

In that case, you'd want to specify that claim with the `idToken()` method:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oidcLogin()
                .idToken(token -> token.claim("user_id", "1234"))
        )
    );
----

since `OidcUser` collects its claims from `OidcIdToken`.

[[testing-oidc-login-user]]
===== Additional Configurations

There are additional methods, too, for further configuring the authentication; it simply depends on what data your controller expects:

* `userInfo(OidcUserInfo.Builder)` - For configuring the `OidcUserInfo` instance
* `clientRegistration(ClientRegistration)` - For configuring the associated `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` with a given `ClientRegistration`
* `oidcUser(OidcUser)` - For configuring the complete `OidcUser` instance

That last one is handy if you:
1. Have your own implementation of `OidcUser`, or
2. Need to change the name attribute

For example, let's say that your authorization server sends the principal name in the `user_name` claim instead of the `sub` claim.
In that case, you can configure an `OidcUser` by hand:

[source,java]
----
OidcUser oidcUser = new DefaultOidcUser(
        AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("SCOPE_message:read"),
        Collections.singletonMap("user_name", "foo_user"),
        "user_name");

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oidcLogin().oidcUser(oidcUser))
    );
----

[[testing-oauth2-login]]
==== Testing OAuth 2.0 Login

As with <<testing-oidc-login,testing OIDC login>>, testing OAuth 2.0 Login presents a similar challenge of mocking a grant flow.
And because of that, Spring Security also has test support for non-OIDC use cases.

Let's say that we've got a controller that gets the logged-in user as an `OAuth2User`:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(@AuthenticationPrincipal OAuth2User oauth2User) {
    return oauth2User.getAttribute("sub");
}
----

In that case, we can tell Spring Security to include a default `OAuth2User` using the `SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors#oauth2User` method, like so:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint").with(oauth2Login()));
----

What this will do is configure the associated `MockHttpServletRequest` with an `OAuth2User` that includes a simple `Map` of attributes and `Collection` of granted authorities.

Specifically, it will include a `Map` with a key/value pair of `sub`/`user`:

[source,json]
----
assertThat((String) user.getAttribute("sub")).isEqualTo("user");
----

and a `Collection` of authorities with just one authority, `SCOPE_read`:

[source,json]
----
assertThat(user.getAuthorities()).hasSize(1);
assertThat(user.getAuthorities()).containsExactly(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_read"));
----

Spring Security does the necessary work to make sure that the `OAuth2User` instance is available for <<mvc-authentication-principal,the `@AuthenticationPrincipal` annotation>>.

Further, it also links that `OAuth2User` to a simple instance of `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` that it deposits in a mock `OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`.
This can be handy if your tests <<testing-oauth2-client,use the `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` annotation>>.

[[testing-oauth2-login-authorities]]
===== Configuring Authorities

In many circumstances, your method is protected by filter or method security and needs your `Authentication` to have certain granted authorities to allow the request.

In this case, you can supply what granted authorities you need using the `authorities()` method:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Login()
            .authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_message:read"))
        )
    );
----

[[testing-oauth2-login-claims]]
===== Configuring Claims

And while granted authorities are quite common across all of Spring Security, we also have claims in the case of OAuth 2.0.

Let's say, for example, that you've got a `user_id` attribute that indicates the user's id in your system.
You might access it like so in a controller:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(@AuthenticationPrincipal OAuth2User oauth2User) {
    String userId = oauth2User.getAttribute("user_id");
    // ...
}
----

In that case, you'd want to specify that attribute with the `attributes()` method:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Login()
                .attributes(attrs -> attrs.put("user_id", "1234"))
        )
    );
----

[[testing-oauth2-login-user]]
===== Additional Configurations

There are additional methods, too, for further configuring the authentication; it simply depends on what data your controller expects:

* `clientRegistration(ClientRegistration)` - For configuring the associated `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` with a given `ClientRegistration`
* `oauth2User(OAuth2User)` - For configuring the complete `OAuth2User` instance

That last one is handy if you:
1. Have your own implementation of `OAuth2User`, or
2. Need to change the name attribute

For example, let's say that your authorization server sends the principal name in the `user_name` claim instead of the `sub` claim.
In that case, you can configure an `OAuth2User` by hand:

[source,java]
----
OAuth2User oauth2User = new DefaultOAuth2User(
        AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("SCOPE_message:read"),
        Collections.singletonMap("user_name", "foo_user"),
        "user_name");

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Login().oauth2User(oauth2User))
    );
----

[[testing-oauth2-client]]
==== Testing OAuth 2.0 Clients

Independent of how your user authenticates, you may have other tokens and client registrations that are in play for the request you are testing.
For example, your controller may be relying on the client credentials grant to get a token that isn't associated with the user at all:

[source,json]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("my-app") OAuth2AuthorizedClient authorizedClient) {
    return this.webClient.get()
        .attributes(oauth2AuthorizedClient(authorizedClient))
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono(String.class)
        .block();
}
----

Simulating this handshake with the authorization server could be cumbersome.
Instead, you can use `SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessor#oauth2Client` to add a `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` into a mock `OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint").with(oauth2Client("my-app")));
----

What this will do is create an `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` that has a simple `ClientRegistration`, `OAuth2AccessToken`, and resource owner name.

Specifically, it will include a `ClientRegistration` with a client id of "test-client" and client secret of "test-secret":

[source,json]
----
assertThat(authorizedClient.getClientRegistration().getClientId()).isEqualTo("test-client");
assertThat(authorizedClient.getClientRegistration().getClientSecret()).isEqualTo("test-secret");
----

a resource owner name of "user":

[source,json]
----
assertThat(authorizedClient.getPrincipalName()).isEqualTo("user");
----

and an `OAuth2AccessToken` with just one scope, `read`:

[source,json]
----
assertThat(authorizedClient.getAccessToken().getScopes()).hasSize(1);
assertThat(authorizedClient.getAccessToken().getScopes()).containsExactly("read");
----

The client can then be retrieved as normal using `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` in a controller method.

[[testing-oauth2-client-scopes]]
===== Configuring Scopes

In many circumstances, the OAuth 2.0 access token comes with a set of scopes.
If your controller inspects these, say like so:

[source,json]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("my-app") OAuth2AuthorizedClient authorizedClient) {
    Set<String> scopes = authorizedClient.getAccessToken().getScopes();
    if (scopes.contains("message:read")) {
        return this.webClient.get()
            .attributes(oauth2AuthorizedClient(authorizedClient))
            .retrieve()
            .bodyToMono(String.class)
            .block();
    }
    // ...
}
----

then you can configure the scope using the `accessToken()` method:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Client("my-app")
            .accessToken(new OAuth2AccessToken(BEARER, "token", null, null, Collections.singleton("message:read"))))
        )
    );
----

[[testing-oauth2-client-registration]]
===== Additional Configurations

There are additional methods, too, for further configuring the authentication; it simply depends on what data your controller expects:

* `principalName(String)` - For configuring the resource owner name
* `clientRegistration(Consumer<ClientRegistration.Builder>)` - For configuring the associated `ClientRegistration`
* `clientRegistration(ClientRegistration)` - For configuring the complete `ClientRegistration`

That last one is handy if you want to use a real `ClientRegistration`

For example, let's say that you are wanting to use one of your app's `ClientRegistration` definitions, as specified in your `application.yml`.

In that case, your test can autowire the `ClientRegistrationRepository` and look up the one your test needs:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
ClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository;

// ...

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(oauth2Client()
            .clientRegistration(this.clientRegistrationRepository.findByRegistrationId("facebook"))));
----

[[testing-jwt]]
==== Testing JWT Authentication

In order to make an authorized request on a resource server, you need a bearer token.

If your resource server is configured for JWTs, then this would mean that the bearer token needs to be signed and then encoded according to the JWT specification.
All of this can be quite daunting, especially when this isn't the focus of your test.

Fortunately, there are a number of simple ways that you can overcome this difficulty and allow your tests to focus on authorization and not on representing bearer tokens.
We'll look at two of them now:

===== `jwt() RequestPostProcessor`

The first way is via a `RequestPostProcessor`.
The simplest of these would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint").with(jwt()));
----

What this will do is create a mock `Jwt`, passing it correctly through any authentication APIs so that it's available for your authorization mechanisms to verify.

By default, the `JWT` that it creates has the following characteristics:

[source,json]
----
{
  "headers" : { "alg" : "none" },
  "claims" : {
    "sub" : "user",
    "scope" : "read"
  }
}
----

And the resulting `Jwt`, were it tested, would pass in the following way:

[source,java]
----
assertThat(jwt.getTokenValue()).isEqualTo("token");
assertThat(jwt.getHeaders().get("alg")).isEqualTo("none");
assertThat(jwt.getSubject()).isEqualTo("sub");
GrantedAuthority authority = jwt.getAuthorities().iterator().next();
assertThat(authority.getAuthority()).isEqualTo("read");
----

These values can, of course be configured.

Any headers or claims can be configured with their corresponding methods:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().jwt(jwt -> jwt.header("kid", "one").claim("iss", "https://idp.example.org"))));
----

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().jwt(jwt -> jwt.claims(claims -> claims.remove("scope")))));
----

The `scope` and `scp` claims are processed the same way here as they are in a normal bearer token request.
However, this can be overridden simply by providing the list of `GrantedAuthority` instances that you need for your test:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_messages"))));
----

Or, if you have a custom `Jwt` to `Collection<GrantedAuthority>` converter, you can also use that to derive the authorities:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().authorities(new MyConverter())));
----

You can also specify a complete `Jwt`, for which `{security-api-url}org/springframework/security/oauth2/jwt/Jwt.Builder.html[Jwt.Builder]` comes quite handy:

[source,java]
----
Jwt jwt = Jwt.withTokenValue("token")
    .header("alg", "none")
    .claim("sub", "user")
    .claim("scope", "read");

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(jwt().jwt(jwt)));
----

===== `authentication()` `RequestPostProcessor`

The second way is by using the `authentication()` `RequestPostProcessor`.
Essentially, you can instantiate your own `JwtAuthenticationToken` and provide it in your test, like so:

[source,java]
----
Jwt jwt = Jwt.withTokenValue("token")
    .header("alg", "none")
    .claim("sub", "user")
    .build();
Collection<GrantedAuthority> authorities = AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("SCOPE_read");
JwtAuthenticationToken token = new JwtAuthenticationToken(jwt, authorities);

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(authentication(token)));
----

Note that as an alternative to these, you can also mock the `JwtDecoder` bean itself with a `@MockBean` annotation.

[[testing-opaque-token]]
==== Testing Opaque Token Authentication

Similar to <<testing-jwt,JWTs>>, opaque tokens require an authorization server in order to verify their validity, which can make testing more difficult.
To help with that, Spring Security has test support for opaque tokens.

Let's say that we've got a controller that retrieves the authentication as a `BearerTokenAuthentication`:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(BearerTokenAuthentication authentication) {
    return (String) authentication.getTokenAttributes("sub");
}
----

In that case, we can tell Spring Security to include a default `BearerTokenAuthentication` using the `SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors#opaqueToken` method, like so:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint").with(opaqueToken()));
----

What this will do is configure the associated `MockHttpServletRequest` with a `BearerTokenAuthentication` that includes a simple `OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal`, `Map` of attributes, and `Collection` of granted authorities.

Specifically, it will include a `Map` with a key/value pair of `sub`/`user`:

[source,json]
----
assertThat((String) token.getTokenAttributes().get("sub")).isEqualTo("user");
----

and a `Collection` of authorities with just one authority, `SCOPE_read`:

[source,json]
----
assertThat(token.getAuthorities()).hasSize(1);
assertThat(token.getAuthorities()).containsExactly(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_read"));
----

Spring Security does the necessary work to make sure that the `BearerTokenAuthentication` instance is available for your controller methods.

[[testing-opaque-token-authorities]]
===== Configuring Authorities

In many circumstances, your method is protected by filter or method security and needs your `Authentication` to have certain granted authorities to allow the request.

In this case, you can supply what granted authorities you need using the `authorities()` method:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(opaqueToken()
            .authorities(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("SCOPE_message:read"))
        )
    );
----

[[testing-opaque-token-attributes]]
===== Configuring Claims

And while granted authorities are quite common across all of Spring Security, we also have attributes in the case of OAuth 2.0.

Let's say, for example, that you've got a `user_id` attribute that indicates the user's id in your system.
You might access it like so in a controller:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/endpoint")
public String foo(BearerTokenAuthentication authentication) {
    String userId = (String) authentication.getTokenAttributes().get("user_id");
    // ...
}
----

In that case, you'd want to specify that attribute with the `attributes()` method:

[source,java]
----
mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(opaqueToken()
                .attributes(attrs -> attrs.put("user_id", "1234"))
        )
    );
----

[[testing-opaque-token-principal]]
===== Additional Configurations

There are additional methods, too, for further configuring the authentication; it simply depends on what data your controller expects.

One such is `principal(OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal)`, which you can use to configure the complete `OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal` instance that underlies the `BearerTokenAuthentication`

It's handy if you:
1. Have your own implementation of `OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal`, or
2. Want to specify a different principal name

For example, let's say that your authorization server sends the principal name in the `user_name` attribute instead of the `sub` attribute.
In that case, you can configure an `OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal` by hand:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> attributes = Collections.singletonMap("user_name", "foo_user");
OAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal = new DefaultOAuth2AuthenticatedPrincipal(
        (String) attributes.get("user_name"),
        attributes,
        AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("SCOPE_message:read"));

mvc
    .perform(get("/endpoint")
        .with(opaqueToken().principal(principal))
    );
----

Note that as an alternative to using `opaqueToken()` test support, you can also mock the `OpaqueTokenIntrospector` bean itself with a `@MockBean` annotation.

=== SecurityMockMvcRequestBuilders

Spring MVC Test also provides a `RequestBuilder` interface that can be used to create the `MockHttpServletRequest` used in your test.
Spring Security provides a few `RequestBuilder` implementations that can be used to make testing easier.
In order to use Spring Security's `RequestBuilder` implementations ensure the following static import is used:

[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.request.SecurityMockMvcRequestBuilders.*;
----

==== Testing Form Based Authentication

You can easily create a request to test a form based authentication using Spring Security's testing support.
For example, the following will submit a POST to "/login" with the username "user", the password "password", and a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin())
----

It is easy to customize the request.
For example, the following will submit a POST to "/auth" with the username "admin", the password "pass", and a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin("/auth").user("admin").password("pass"))
----

We can also customize the parameters names that the username and password are included on.
For example, this is the above request modified to include the username on the HTTP parameter "u" and the password on the HTTP parameter "p".

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin("/auth").user("u","admin").password("p","pass"))
----

[[test-logout]]
==== Testing Logout

While fairly trivial using standard Spring MVC Test, you can use Spring Security's testing support to make testing log out easier.
For example, the following will submit a POST to "/logout" with a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(logout())
----

You can also customize the URL to post to.
For example, the snippet below will submit a POST to "/signout" with a valid CSRF token:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(logout("/signout"))
----

=== SecurityMockMvcResultMatchers

At times it is desirable to make various security related assertions about a request.
To accommodate this need, Spring Security Test support implements Spring MVC Test's `ResultMatcher` interface.
In order to use Spring Security's `ResultMatcher` implementations ensure the following static import is used:

[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.response.SecurityMockMvcResultMatchers.*;
----

==== Unauthenticated Assertion

At times it may be valuable to assert that there is no authenticated user associated with the result of a `MockMvc` invocation.
For example, you might want to test submitting an invalid username and password and verify that no user is authenticated.
You can easily do this with Spring Security's testing support using something like the following:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().password("invalid"))
	.andExpect(unauthenticated());
----

==== Authenticated Assertion

It is often times that we must assert that an authenticated user exists.
For example, we may want to verify that we authenticated successfully.
We could verify that a form based login was successful with the following snippet of code:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin())
	.andExpect(authenticated());
----

If we wanted to assert the roles of the user, we could refine our previous code as shown below:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().user("admin"))
	.andExpect(authenticated().withRoles("USER","ADMIN"));
----

Alternatively, we could verify the username:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().user("admin"))
	.andExpect(authenticated().withUsername("admin"));
----

We can also combine the assertions:

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin().user("admin").roles("USER","ADMIN"))
	.andExpect(authenticated().withUsername("admin"));
----

We can also make arbitrary assertions on the authentication

[source,java]
----
mvc
	.perform(formLogin())
	.andExpect(authenticated().withAuthentication(auth ->
		assertThat(auth).isInstanceOf(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class)));
----
