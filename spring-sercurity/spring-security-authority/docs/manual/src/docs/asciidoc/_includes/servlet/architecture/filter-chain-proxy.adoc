= FilterChainProxy

Spring Security's Servlet support is contained within `FilterChainProxy`.
`FilterChainProxy` is a special `Filter` provided by Spring Security that allows delegating to many `Filter` instances through <<servlet-securityfilterchain,`SecurityFilterChain`>>.
Since `FilterChainProxy` is a Bean, it is typically wrapped in a <<servlet-delegatingfilterproxy>>.
