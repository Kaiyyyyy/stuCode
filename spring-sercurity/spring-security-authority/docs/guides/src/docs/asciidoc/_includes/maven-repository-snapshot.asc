In order to resolve Spring Security SNAPSHOT dependencies add the Spring Snapshot repository. For our example, the repository has already been added for you. In the event you were working on another application, you would need to ensure you add the following to your pom:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <!-- ... possibly other repository elements ... -->
  <repository>
    <id>spring-snapshot</id>
    <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
    <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
