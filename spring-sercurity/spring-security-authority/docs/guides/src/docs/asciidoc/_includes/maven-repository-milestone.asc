In order to resolve Spring Security milestones and release candidates add the Spring Milestone repository. For our example, the repository has already been added for you. In the event you were working on another application, you would need to ensure you add the following to your pom:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <!-- ... possibly other repository elements ... -->
  <repository>
    <id>spring-milestone</id>
    <name>Spring Milestone Repository</name>
    <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
